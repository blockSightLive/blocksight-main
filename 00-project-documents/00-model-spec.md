# BlockSight.live - Bitcoin Blockchain Analysis System Specification

## Overview

BlockSight.live is a cutting-edge platform designed for real-time monitoring and analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain. Our mission is to make blockchain data accessible, understandable, and actionable for all users. By focusing exclusively on Bitcoin, we create tools that enhance the network's resilience, privacy, and usability, empowering users to navigate the Bitcoin ecosystem with confidence.

BlockSight.live provides information and insights about the Bitcoin network but does not assist with fund recovery, wallet-related issues, or similar matters. The platform does not process Bitcoin transactions and cannot expedite, cancel, or replace pending transactions. Users should contact their wallet software or exchange platform for such concerns.

This specification defines the desired behavior, architecture, and implementation standards for BlockSight.live, focusing exclusively on Bitcoin while developing innovative tools that enhance privacy, security, and usability.

## Core Principles

### 1. User-Centric Design

BlockSight.live must prioritize user experience, making complex blockchain data accessible to both beginners and professionals. Every feature should be intuitive, clear, and practical.

### 2. Real-Time Performance

The system must provide real-time detection and notifications with realistic response times. Live blockchain status, transaction tracking, and network load monitoring must deliver updates within 1-2 seconds of detection.

### 3. Data Accuracy and Privacy

All blockchain data must be 100% accurate and validated against Bitcoin Core. The system must maintain data integrity while respecting user privacy and security.

### 4. Bitcoin-Exclusive Focus

BlockSight.live focuses exclusively on Bitcoin, providing deep, specialized insights rather than broad cryptocurrency coverage. This specialization enables superior analysis and user experience.

### 5. Accessibility and Usability

Advanced blockchain tools must be accessible to users of all technical levels. Complex data should be presented in clear, visual formats that enhance understanding and decision-making.

### 6. Scalability and Reliability

The system must support thousands of concurrent users while maintaining 99.99% uptime. Horizontal and vertical scaling strategies must be implemented from the ground up.

### 7. Open Source Foundation

All components must respect open source licenses, particularly the MIT license for electrs integration, while maintaining commercial viability and developing our own implementation layers.

## Implementation Timeline

### Pre-indexing Prerequisites

**Critical**: System cannot start without pre-indexing completion

- Day 1-7: Install Bitcoin Core → Sync blockchain
- Day 8: Install electrs → Start indexing
- Day 8-9: Wait for indexing to complete (6-24 hours)
- Day 9: Start NodeJS Backend → System ready

**Note**: This timeline assumes optimal hardware. On slower systems, indexing can take 2-7 days.

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 2-4)**

- HTTP API integration layer development
- Multi-tier caching system implementation
- WebSocket real-time event system
- Checkpoint system development

**Phase 2: Performance (Weeks 5-8)**

- Connection pooling and circuit breaker implementation
- Memory management optimization
- Comprehensive error recovery
- Data validation layers

**Phase 3: Testing (Weeks 9-12)**

- Comprehensive test suite development
- HTTP API integration testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Data accuracy validation

**Phase 4: Production (Weeks 13-16)**

- Monitoring and observability
- Security implementation
- Documentation and deployment
- Performance tuning
