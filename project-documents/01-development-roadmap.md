Note on document split: This file is the high-level strategy. The detailed, step-by-step execution checklists (per phase, per module), including gating criteria from the legend, live in `01-execution-checklists.md`.

---

## Product Lines & Access Model

- BlockSight (Web, free): public, React-based real‑time Bitcoin explorer. Shows minimal MVP data for blocks/transactions/addresses; donations welcome; no advanced analytics.
- BlockInsight (Commercial): subscription analytics suite (mobile via Expo + web) with premium dashboards, curated reports, export APIs, and embeddable CDN widgets with higher refresh/SLA. Shares ingestion/adapters; adds multi‑tenant auth, billing, API keys, usage metering, feature flags. No electrs modifications.

---

## 🪜 Incremental MVP‑First Development Policy

- Phase 1 delivers a working frontend connected to electrs data via a minimal backend adapter. Start with the `electrum-client` library for faster integration and proven stability, keeping the client behind an adapter interface so we can swap to a custom TCP wrapper later if needed. No advanced analytics, clustering, Lightning, or cross‑chain.
  - Potential TCP wrapper evaluation: schedule a spike in Phase 2 hardening or Phase 3 QA based on metrics (latency variance, backpressure behavior, reconnection edge cases). Proceed to build a custom wrapper only if measurable benefits outweigh maintenance cost.
- Each subsequent phase expands functionality only after stability, performance, and UX hardening of the prior phase.
- Any non‑MVP work in a phase requires explicit scope approval and a follow‑up phase entry.

### Internationalization (i18n) Program
- Phase 1 (MVP): Establish i18next foundation with `en`, `es`, `he`, `pt`; implement language toggle; locale formatting for currency/date/number; enable RTL for `he`.
- Phase 2 (Hardening): Complete coverage of UI strings; CI missing-key detection; RTL layout audits and fixes.
- Phase 3 (QA): Snapshot tests by locale; visual regression LTR/RTL; code-splitting of locales to stay within bundle budgets.

## Developer Toolkit (Legend‑Driven)

Use this template for any task; keep it in PR description to enforce gates.

Task Template
- Goal: <one sentence>
- Scope guard: <explicitly excluded>
- Budgets: latency/memory/SLOs touched
- Risks: consensus, performance, security

DoR
- $ Issue linked + branch created
- # Test plan (tiers/fixtures) sketched
- @ Consensus impact reviewed (if applicable)
- * Perf/Sec budgets stated; threat model note
- & Docs to touch listed (README paths)
- % Rollback plan (flag/kill switch) defined
- 🚀 CI jobs identified; IaC needs listed
- 🔒 Secrets/SBOM checks planned
- 📊 SLOs/signals to watch named

Artifacts
- Contracts (OpenAPI/JSON Schemas) as relevant
- Code + tests + dashboards/alerts as relevant
- Runbooks; ADRs if architecture changed

DoD
- CI green; coverage thresholds met
- SLOs within budgets; alerts quiet
- Docs updated; links verified
- Flags enabled + rollback rehearsed in staging
- Parity checks vs Core/electrs if applicable

Quick Commands (see README)
- npm run dev | dev:frontend | dev:backend | lint | typecheck | test | build
- docker:up | docker:logs | docker:down
- git submodule init && git submodule update
- npm run health:check | logs:view | metrics:view

SLO Quick Reference
- API P95 <200ms cached; <500ms uncached
- WebSocket end‑to‑end ≤2s
- electrs tip‑lag ≤3 blocks
- CDN widgets bootstrap <200ms; refresh within budget

## 🔷 Engineering Axioms (operate by default unless explicitly overridden)

- Optimize for correctness first, then performance. Never trade consensus correctness for speed.
- Prefer small, reversible changes. One logical change per pull request; small PRs (<400 LOC) with fast review cycles.
- Tests define behavior. Practice TDD for critical paths; no merge without green tests and quality gates.
- Automate everything repeatable (build, test, security, performance, release, rollback).
- Measure to improve. Track DORA metrics (deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change fail rate) and Bitcoin-specific SLOs.
- Fail safely. Design circuit breakers, timeouts, retries, and rollbacks before adding new capabilities.
- Single source of truth. The `README.md` defines operational commands; this roadmap defines what and why; execution details live in `01-execution-checklists.md`.
- Keep dependencies up to date with automated scanning and patches; never fork electrs inside this repo.
- Data is immutable; treat blockchain data as append-only; reconcile via Bitcoin Core on doubt.
- Security is a feature. Cryptographic validation and least-privilege by default.

---

## Environment Topology (Dev → Prod)

- Development (single machine): Windows host runs frontend/backend/electrs. Bitcoin Core runs in a Linux VM (WSL2/VirtualBox/VMware). electrs points to the VM’s Core RPC/P2P over a private/host-only network. Enforce time sync, SSD-backed storage, and host firewall rules allowing only required ports.
- Production (AWS): VPC with public subnets for API/CDN and private subnets for Bitcoin Core and electrs. Security groups restrict RPC to private networks; electrs is not Internet-exposed. Multi‑AZ active/standby electrs; API behind gateway/ingress; object storage (S3) for media.

## 🏗️ **PROGRAMMING PARADIGMS & DESIGN PATTERNS STRATEGY**

### **OOP vs Functional Programming Decision Framework**

#### **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - When to Use**
- **Stateful Operations**: Bitcoin transaction processing, UTXO management, cache state management
- **Complex Domain Models**: Bitcoin script parsing, address validation, consensus rule enforcement
- **Inheritance Hierarchies**: Script type classification, transaction type hierarchies, validation rule inheritance
- **Encapsulation Requirements**: Private key handling, cryptographic operations, sensitive data management
- **Design Patterns**: Factory for script creation, Singleton for configuration management, Strategy for validation rules

#### **Functional Programming (FP) - When to Use**
- **Data Transformation**: Bitcoin data parsing, JSON processing, API response formatting
- **Immutable Operations**: Hash calculations, signature verification, block validation
- **Pure Functions**: Mathematical calculations, fee estimation algorithms, statistical computations
- **Stream Processing**: Real-time data flows, WebSocket event handling, log processing
- **Error Handling**: Result types, Either monads, functional error propagation

#### **Hybrid Approach - Best of Both Worlds**
- **Core Bitcoin Logic**: OOP for domain models, FP for data transformations
- **API Layer**: FP for request/response handling, OOP for business logic
- **Caching Layer**: OOP for state management, FP for cache key generation
- **Validation Layer**: FP for input validation, OOP for complex rule evaluation

### **Critical Design Patterns for Bitcoin Development**

#### **Factory Pattern** 🏗️
- **Script Factory**: Create Bitcoin script objects based on type (P2PKH, P2SH, P2WPKH, P2WSH, P2TR)
- **Transaction Factory**: Build different transaction types with proper validation
- **Validator Factory**: Create appropriate validators for different Bitcoin consensus rules
- **Cache Factory**: Generate cache instances with different strategies (Redis, Memory-mapped, Nginx)

#### **Singleton Pattern** 🏗️
- **Configuration Manager**: Single source of truth for Bitcoin network parameters
- **Database Connection Pool**: Centralized connection management across modules
- **Logger Instance**: Unified logging with Bitcoin-specific context
- **Metrics Collector**: Centralized performance and health monitoring

#### **Strategy Pattern** 🏗️
- **Validation Strategies**: Different validation approaches for different script types
- **Caching Strategies**: L1/L2/L3 cache selection based on data characteristics
- **Error Handling Strategies**: Different recovery mechanisms for different failure types
- **Performance Optimization Strategies**: Different algorithms based on data size and complexity

#### **Observer Pattern** 🏗️
- **Block Event System**: Notify subscribers of new blocks and confirmations
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Real-time updates for address and transaction changes

- **Cache Key Builder**: Generate optimized cache keys for different data types

### **SOLID Principles Application**

#### **Single Responsibility Principle**
- **Script Parser**: Only responsible for parsing Bitcoin scripts, not validation
- **Transaction Validator**: Only responsible for validation, not storage
- **Cache Manager**: Only responsible for caching, not business logic

#### **Open/Closed Principle**
- **Script Type System**: Extensible for new script types without modifying existing code
- **Validation Rules**: New consensus rules can be added without changing existing validators
- **Cache Strategies**: New caching mechanisms can be implemented without modifying core logic

#### **Liskov Substitution Principle**
- **Script Types**: All script implementations must be interchangeable
- **Validators**: Different validation strategies must be substitutable
- **Cache Implementations**: Different cache types must be interchangeable

#### **Interface Segregation Principle**
- **Bitcoin APIs**: Separate interfaces for different types of Bitcoin data
- **Validation Interfaces**: Specific interfaces for different validation concerns
- **Cache Interfaces**: Minimal interfaces for different cache operations

#### **Dependency Inversion Principle**
- **High-level modules**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
- **Bitcoin logic**: Depend on interfaces, not concrete Bitcoin implementations
- **External services**: Depend on service contracts, not specific implementations

## 🔒 **BITCOIN DEVELOPMENT RISK MITIGATION**

### **Critical Bitcoin-Specific Risks**

#### **Consensus Rule Compliance**

- **Risk**: Misinterpreting Bitcoin consensus rules leading to invalid data (script execution errors, signature validation failures, block validation errors, transaction acceptance discrepancies, soft fork activation mishandling, BIP compliance violations) **@** **#**
- **Mitigation**: Formal verification against Bitcoin Core RPC (getblockchaininfo, validateblock, getrawtransaction cross-verification), comprehensive script type testing (all P2PKH/P2SH/P2WPKH/P2WSH/P2TR variants, edge cases, malformed scripts), libsecp256k1 integration for cryptographic operations, consensus rule test vectors **@** **#** **\***
- **Validation**: Cross-reference all data with Bitcoin Core RPC every 10 blocks, automated consensus checking with 100% accuracy requirement, script execution verification, signature validation testing, consensus failure alerting with immediate escalation **@** **#** **\***

#### **Cryptographic Validation Failures**

- **Risk**: Incorrect cryptographic implementations compromising security (signature verification bypass, hash function errors, public key validation failures, elliptic curve parameter errors, entropy generation weaknesses, timing attack vulnerabilities) **@** **\***
- **Mitigation**: Use Bitcoin Core primitives exclusively (libsecp256k1 for ECDSA/Schnorr, Bitcoin Core hash functions), extensive cryptographic testing (signature verification test vectors, malformed signature handling, edge case validation), hardware security module integration for sensitive operations **@** **\*** **&**
- **Validation**: Cryptographic audit by certified security firms, peer review by Bitcoin cryptography experts, formal verification of critical paths, penetration testing focused on cryptographic implementations, regular security assessment updates **@** **\*** **&**

#### **Bitcoin Network State Inconsistency**

- **Risk**: Block reorganizations causing data inconsistency across modules (orphan block handling, UTXO set corruption, cache invalidation failures, transaction confirmation state errors, address balance discrepancies, analytics data corruption) **@** **#** **\***
- **Mitigation**: Block height tracking with fork detection, reorganization detection within 1-2 blocks, checkpoint recovery system with state validation, atomic operations for state updates, eventual consistency protocols with reconciliation **@** **#** **\***
- **Validation**: Regular Bitcoin network state validation every 30 minutes, automated reconciliation with Bitcoin Core, orphan block simulation testing, cache consistency verification, state recovery testing with historical reorganizations **@** **#** **\***

#### **Performance Under Bitcoin Network Load**

- **Risk**: System failure during Bitcoin network stress (memory pool >100MB, blocks >2MB, transaction volume >7 TPS sustained, fee spikes >1000 sat/vB, mining pool concentration, network partitions) **@** **\*** **#**
- **Mitigation**: Load testing with historical high-volume periods (2017 congestion, 2021 adoption surge), circuit breaker implementation (5 failures, 30s timeout), auto-scaling with Node.js cluster mode, cache optimization under load, database connection throttling **@** **\*** **#**
- **Validation**: Stress testing with Bitcoin network simulation (mainnet transaction replay), gradual scaling validation (500→1K→5K→10K users), performance degradation monitoring, failover testing, disaster recovery procedures **@** **\*** **#** **%**
