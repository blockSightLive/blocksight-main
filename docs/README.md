## ðŸ“š Documentation Navigation

**Start here**: [Documentation Navigation Guide](DOCUMENTATION-NAVIGATION.md) - Complete overview of all documentation files and their purposes

## Recommended reading order (first week)
1. README.md (root): Project overview and CI/CD summary
2. docs/onboarding.md: Setup, week plan, first tasks
3. docs/developer-handbook.md: How to use this handbook + Glossary â†’ Backend/i18n sections
4. project-documents/00-model-spec.md: What weâ€™re building and why
5. project-documents/system-diagrams/*: Visualize the architecture

## Purpose-based navigation
- Getting started: docs/onboarding.md
- Daily work (how to code here): docs/developer-handbook.md
- Standards (naming, patterns, quality bars): docs/code-standard.md
- **Frontend Development**: [docs/frontend/](frontend/) - Complete frontend documentation
- **Naming Conventions**: [docs/frontend/naming-conventions.md](frontend/naming-conventions.md) (CRITICAL - Single source of truth)
- Install commands and post-install steps: docs/install-notes.md
- **Current Infrastructure State**: See developer-handbook.md for validated network topology
- **Infrastructure & Deployment**: [docs/infrastructure/](infrastructure/) - Infrastructure overview and deployment guides
- Testing stack: Jest + ts-jest + supertest (backend); wired in CI

- Roadmap and checklists: project-documents/01-development-roadmap.md and 01-execution-checklists.md

## Tips
- Prefer diagrams-first for non-trivial changes. Update diagrams and specs alongside code.
- Never hardcode UI strings; follow i18n rules in the handbook.
- Keep PRs small; run typecheck/lint/tests locally before push.
